################ HOW IT WORKS##################

# You define a list called list containing numbers from 2 to 10.
# You create a function prime_checker that takes a number as an argument.
# Inside the function, you use a for loop to iterate over each element in the list.
# In each iteration, you check if the given number (n) is divisible evenly by the current prime from the list using the modulus operator (%).
# If the number is divisible, you print "It's not a prime number." and use the break statement to exit the loop.
# If the loop completes without finding any divisor, the else block is executed, and you print "It's a prime number."
# Finally, you take user input for a number (n) and call the prime_checker function with that input.
